            <h2>Pride and Prejudice</h2>
            <div>
                <p>It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife. However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.</p> 
                <p>"My dear Mr. Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?" Mr. Bennet replied that he had not. "But it is," returned she; "for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it." Mr. Bennet made no answer. "Do you not want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife impatiently. "You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it." This was invitation enough.</p> 
                <p>"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week."</p>
                <p>"What is his name?" "Bingley." "Is he married or single?" "Oh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!" "How so? How can it affect them?" "My dear Mr. Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them." "Is that his design in settling here?" "Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes."</p>
                <p>"I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the party." "My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty." "In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of."</p> 
                <p>"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood." "It is more than I engage for, I assure you." "But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account; for in general you know they visit no new-comers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him if you do not." "You are over scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy."</p>

    <h2>CSS Animation</h2>

    <div>

    <p>CSS animation is a powerful tool for adding engaging and interactive visual effects to a website or web application. It allows web developers to create dynamic and eye-catching animations that can enhance the user experience and make a website feel more modern and polished. In this blog post, we will explore the basics of CSS animation, how it works, and some tips for getting started.</p>
    <H3>What is CSS animation?</H3>
    <p>CSS animation is a technique for adding movement and visual effects to web pages using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). With CSS animation, web developers can create transitions and animations that can be triggered by user actions, such as clicking a button or hovering over an element. CSS animation is a popular alternative to using JavaScript for animation, as it can often be faster and more lightweight.</p>
    <h3>How does CSS animation work?</h3>
    <p>CSS animation works by using CSS properties to change the appearance of an element over time. To create an animation, developers define a set of keyframes, which specify how the element should look at different points in time. For example, a keyframe might define the position, size, and color of an element at the start and end of an animation. Developers can then use the @keyframes rule in CSS to define the animation sequence. The @keyframes rule specifies the name of the animation, the duration of the animation, and the keyframes that make up the animation. Developers can also use other CSS properties to control the timing and behavior of the animation, such as easing functions, delay times, and iteration counts.</p>

    <h3>Tips for getting started with CSS animation</h3>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>Start simple: When getting started with CSS animation, it's best to start with simple animations and work your way up to more complex ones. Try experimenting with basic properties like opacity and transform to get a feel for how animation works.</li>
        <li>Use easing functions: Easing functions can be used to control the rate of change in an animation. They can be used to create more natural-looking animations that don't feel jarring or abrupt.</li>
        <li>Test across browsers: CSS animation is supported across most modern browsers, but there can be slight differences in how different browsers handle animation. Be sure to test your animations across different browsers to ensure they work correctly.</li>
        <li>Use animation libraries: There are many animation libraries available that can help simplify the process of creating complex animations. Libraries like Animate.css and AOS can be used to quickly add pre-built animations to your website.</li>
